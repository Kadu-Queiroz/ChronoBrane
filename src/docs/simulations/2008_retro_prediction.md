# Simulation: 2008 Financial Crisis (Retro Prediction)

## Objective
Test the system against a known real-world collapse.

## Input Data
- Financial indicators (2006–2008)
- Rising entropy signals before collapse

## Outcomes
- Successful prediction of September 2008 event
- Ethical vectors highlighted unused safer paths

## Implications
Supports the system’s ability to detect latent collapses and propose more stable trajectories.

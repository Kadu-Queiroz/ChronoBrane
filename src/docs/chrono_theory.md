# ChronoBrane â€“ Core Theory

## Introduction
ChronoBrane is a model that treats time as a navigable and deformable dimension, enabling simulations of future ethical and informational trajectories.

## Theoretical Foundations
- Inspired by differential geometry applied to temporal flow.
- Conceptually derived from M-theory branes, adapted to moral and computational decision systems.

## Purpose
To simulate existential navigation and detect potential ethical or temporal collapses.

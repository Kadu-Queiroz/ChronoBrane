# 🌌 ChronosBrane

**ChronosBrane** is a symbolic and ethical navigation framework for predictive temporal modeling.  
It is designed to anticipate systemic collapses, simulate future decision paths, and guide agents toward ethically sustainable actions — all grounded in mathematically defined gradients of time, entropy, and moral consequence.

---

## 🧠 What is ChronosBrane?

ChronosBrane is a computable structure that merges:

- Temporal Collapse Prediction (from symbolic-spatial tensors)
- Ethical Gradient Navigation (Ozires-A Gradient)
- Social & Economic Entropy Tracking
- Simulation of Causality-aware Futures

It is both a mathematical model and a philosophical framework for decision-making.

## 📐 Core Equation – Ozires-A Patent

\[
\mathcal{O}\!\!A\text{-Patent} = \left[ \nabla\mathcal{O} \oplus \overrightarrow{\nabla O\!A} \right] \otimes \Gamma(\mathcal{E})
\]

**Meaning:**  
The patent is the symbolic convergence between temporal collapse gradients (∇𝒪), optimal moral action vectors (→∇OA), and ethical structure fields (Γ(ℰ)).

This forms the core navigation system that anticipates events and adapts behavior accordingly.
